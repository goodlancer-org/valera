Valera is a social robot aimed to be the cheapest one able to communicate with people and emotionally react to them.
Valera can act as a friend or a teacher. 

What are social robots
--------------------------------

Social robots can keep human knowledge and culture the same way as do books, photos, movies, 
stories and so on. Even if there only one person left in the world holding some rare culture, 
social robots can learn this culture and spread it. They cannot replace real persons, 
but they can be made in big quantities, they never forget, never are too busy, too old or sick.

Social robots can listen, understand feelings, react. They can teach and they can be tought.

This is how we see social robots.

What (or who) is Valera 
--------------------------------

Valera is extremely easy and cheap to build and customize.
We provide all the documentation for both the robot hardware and software free of charge.

Valera born to be a social robot, but currently he is not ready to function as one, he is a work in process
and at the current stage we use Valera as an example to describe how to build cost effective robots with
AI and modern software on board easily.

--------------------------------

* Single-board computer like Raspberry PI or Odroid as a braind with AI, camera and sound sensors
* 3d-printing with regular PLA
* Cost-effective servo motors and electronics
